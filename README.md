Subletting has become an increasingly popular thing to do for young people looking for a cheap way to go on vacation or find a new temporary place to stay.

The appeal of subletting is the simplicity of finding a place to stay or a temporary residence for your asset using the many available websites and applications that have been created in recent years, not to mention the lower overall price compared to a hotel or resort.

Our plan for SWoP is to take the comfort and simplicity - one step further.

SWoP is a website designed to help users perform two actions in one - find a place to stay, while also finding a customer to stay at your own place while you're gone, therefore lowering overall costs.


SWoP will create a closed chain of users looking to rent a place while also subletting their own asset, broadening their options for locations and customers.
